## What is Wool Ball?

<Note>
Wool Ball is an innovative client-as-server network that enables browsers to process tasks traditionally requiring dedicated servers. By leveraging browser capabilities, we create a distributed network where users are rewarded for sharing resources, dramatically reducing processing costs.

## How It's Different

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="link" title="vs. Blockchain">
    While similar in using a distributed network, Wool Ball focuses on executing AI models and data processing rather than immutable data recording or consensus mechanisms. This makes it more efficient for computational tasks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="cloud" title="vs. Serverless Computing">
    Unlike traditional serverless solutions that rely on cloud providers, Wool Ball uses browsers as infrastructure, making it more accessible and cost-effective for AI processing tasks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="share-nodes" title="vs. Collaborative Economy">
    Similar to platforms like Uber and Airbnb, Wool Ball utilizes idle resources. However, instead of physical assets, it leverages browser computational power for processing tasks.
