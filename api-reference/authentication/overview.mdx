# Authentication

The Wool Ball API uses Bearer token authentication. All API requests must include an `Authorization` header with a valid API key.

## Authentication Header

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Example Request

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.woolball.xyz/v1/completions \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Security Best Practices

1. Never share your API keys or expose them in client-side code
2. Use environment variables to store API keys
3. Rotate your API keys periodically
4. Use different API keys for development and production environments
